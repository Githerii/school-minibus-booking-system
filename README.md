**Introduction**

In many developing countries, children face significant challenges commuting to school. Public transportation is often unreliable, and private taxis are too expensive for most families. As a result, children must walk long distances to school, exposing them to safety risks, fatigue, and adverse weather conditions. Meanwhile, parents who can afford private transportation have a clear advantage, further widening the gap between low- and high-income families.

 **Problem**

-Lack of Safe & Affordable School Transport 
    Children must walk long distances, often on unsafe roads.
-Limited Options for Parents
    Only wealthier families can afford private cars or taxis.
-Inefficient Transport Management
    Parents lack visibility on available transport options, routes, and schedules.
-No Real-Time Tracking
    Parents have no way of knowing if their child has been picked up or dropped off safely.

**Proposed Solution**

A web-based school minibus booking system built with Next.js (frontend) and Flask with PostgreSQL (backend) will provide an efficient, accessible solution. The system will allow parents to:

1.Book seats for their children on minibuses that follow fixed routes.
2.View available routes and schedules on an interactive map.
3.Track buses in real-time to ensure safe pickup and drop-off.
4.Receive instant notifications when their child is picked up or dropped off.
5.This system will enable private bus operators to efficiently manage bookings, optimize routes, and offer parents a reliable transport solution.
